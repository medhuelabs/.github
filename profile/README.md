## Welcome to MedHue Labs LLC

At MedHue Labs we build where science meets art, and we think AI should feel like collaboration, not
commands. Our product, Tmates, lets you create AI teammates, talk to them like coworkers, delegate
tasks, and get results while you stay focused. They keep running when you're offline, learn from
feedback, and can be tailored to life and work.

Anyone can build a teammate with our TmatesAgentSDK. Feel free to explore our open source software and reach out.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
